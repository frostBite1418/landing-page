# landing-page

This project is dedicated to practicing CSS and HTML concepts, especially the use of Flexbox in designing modern webpages. While I didn't expect to create a decent looking website in just two weeks, here we are -- a responsive webpage. 

There are still limitations in using Flexbox. In future projects, I hope to dabble with CSS grid which might potentially give me more control in my webpages.

Regardless, I hope you have fun and like this project. This is part of my humble beginnings.
